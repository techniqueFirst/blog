* The content/ posts on this website are targetted at people who love to train/ lift AND like me, are mesmerized by this amazing thing called human body and the things it can do. Having said that people who fall into the following categories will find it most relavant (or annoying depending on their personality):

(a) In pain/ injured and are aware of their situation (and hopefully working on fixing it) 
(b) In pain/ injured but don't care as long as they can lift ("but ..but ..the pain goes away after the warm-up!")

Mosts if not all posts are written with a hypothetical athelete in mind (very much like me, who in his career has often been plagued with injuries and nagging pains that always came in the way of )


who I have already not considered as my target audience and I'd emphasize again, has little to benefit from the content I have put out,



TODO:
	- Add the fact that this is targetted at people doing olympic lifting, crossfit (i.e. movement relying on fast twitch fibers and more often than not, are loaded)
