Ever wonder why some olympic lifters look so smooth and have long, mostly injury free careers ? 

Although most attribute such "anomalies" to genetics, starting young, drugs etc, I would flash the light on something that often either gets neglected or misconstrued.

It is these lifters' midsection/core. Not just the superficial (and often flashy) muscles but the "deep" core muscles. The word "deep" implies that they form the very first layer of protection around the spine and other organs.

The "bracing" that you have been taught is incorrect, ineffective and injury prone
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most bracing tutorials and instructions available on the internet today are flat-out ineffective. From a problem solving perspective, it can be said that it is more of a "stop gap" solution than a permanent or reliable one. A simle google search yields these videos and they completely miss the point and

Why deep core muscles haven't come to limelight so far?
-------------------------------------------------------

- people who started young and/or are integrated don't know the other side

- Fully activating the deep core muscles take a lot of determination and practice. 

- people who keep listening to the present nonsense about 360 degree bracing by blowing your stomach out. 

- People believing that they cannot activate these muscles anymore.






Some examples/ demonstrations of being able to activate those muscles:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	- IN a jerk dip and/or jerk drive, the ability to keep the torso exactly straight. 

	- Having no "butt wink" in a squat (mostly back squat)


Do you *need* to activate my deep core muscles?
