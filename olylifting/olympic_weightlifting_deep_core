Ever wonder why some olympic lifters look so smooth and have long, mostly injury free careers ? 

Although most attribute such "anomalies" to genetics, starting young, drugs etc, I would flash the light on something that often either gets neglected or misconstrued.

It is these lifters' midsection/core. Not just the superficial (and often flashy) muscles but the "deep" core muscles. The word "deep" implies that they form the very first layer of protection around the spine and other organs.

The "bracing" that you have been taught is incorrect, ineffective and injury prone

Why deep core muscles haven't come to limelight so far?
-------------------------------------------------------

- people who started young and/or are integrated don't know the other side

- Fully activating the deep core muscles take a lot of determination and practice. 

- people who keep listening to the present nonsense about 360 degree bracing by blowing your stomach out. 

- People believing that they cannot activate these muscles anymore.


Why is it hard to activate DEEP CORE muscles?


 - Lack of awareness, you cannot activate something that your brain cannot find


 - spending time in bad positions over years makes you loose control

 - contracting (or overcontracting) just the superficial ones , you're making it harder for the brain to activate/ turn on that control.

 - loading the superficial only contracted position, you're making the problem even worse. 
 

good part:
with proper control on these, they automatically contract without needing enough effort.





Some examples/ demonstrations of being able to activate those muscles:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	- IN a jerk dip and/or jerk drive, the ability to keep the torso exactly straight. 

	- Having no "butt wink" in a squat (mostly back squat)


Do you *need* to activate my deep core muscles?
