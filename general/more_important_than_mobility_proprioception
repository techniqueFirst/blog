Intro/ Prologue:

In our earlier post <link: not how much you lift, but how you move, we established that the quality (i.e. technique) of movement is of significantly more importance than the quantity (repetition or load). When we shift our focus from short term to long term effect of training on our bodies, it is imperative that the time spent doing quality movements should dictate our training. Thus, as one gets farther away from his/ her prime or has had a late initiation into physical traininig, and is still looking to squeeze true atheletic potential out of oneself, quantity (again, load & reps) shouldn't hold any meaning if it comes at even a small sacrifice of quality (technique & form).    

What you're going to say
-----------------------

With all the hype around mobility and flexibility these days, when thinking about quality we have a tendency to overemphasize the role of these two. The ubiquitious SMR tools in strength/ oly gyms, CrossFit boxes and even yoga studios, seem to convey the message that a bit of pre/post/during (training) mobility is enough to achieve both quantitative and qualitative progress in training. One key element of movement (even more important when the movement is loaded) that is often ignored (or worse, not even thought of) is proprioception, defined in Wikipedia as :

 "Proprioception is the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement"

Please note that a well balanced mobile athelete <link to start here page> won't have to bother with proprioceptive issues and is most likely okay focussing their time in reaping gains (yes, yes, blame it on the genetics).   

One liners/ pointers to add to this :

	- but one of the missing elements is proprioception and/or body awareness
	
	- often gets neglected and is hardest to work upon 
		- specially in an environment dominated by noise, everyone screaming for self approval 
	
	- Only if the difference is zero, can we apply the basic principles of progressive overload to athleticism (strength, speed, agility etc)

	- A one liner to best explain proprioception is the difference between "How one is moving and how one thinks he/she is moving"
		- The bigger the difference, the more of "anti-progress" is made instead of progress
		- The heavier the weight and more the number of reps =>  "anti-training" is happening at a faster rate
