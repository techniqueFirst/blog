Intro/ Prologue:

In our earlier post <link: not how much you lift, but how you move, we established that the quality (i.e. technique) of movement is of significantly more importance than the quantity (repetition or load). When we shift our focus from short term to long term effect of training on our bodies, it is imperative that the time spent doing quality movements should dictate our training. Thus, as one gets farther away from his/ her prime or has had a late initiation into physical traininig, and is still looking to squeeze true atheletic potential out of themselves, quantity (again, load or reps) shouldn't hold any meaning if it comes at even a small amount of sacrifice of quality (technique or form).

Structure :
Review of what is out there 
My opinion of crossfit
My concept of programming (based on FITT)
My assumption of the example athelete in question being a “ready for functional movements” athelete (and the fact that someone who has imbalances, motor control and proprioception, mobility issues makes it a whole different ballgame)
Frequency:
2 – 3x 

Type: technique focused (beginners), weakness focused, corrective, 

Intensity: Relevance of this article we will consider beginner to intermediate weightlifters.  This will be sufficient to encompass most of the people engaging in Crossfit on this planet. Will depend on type

Duration : Depend on both type and intensity.
