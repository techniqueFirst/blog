Intro/ Prologue:
---------------

In our earlier post <link: not how much you lift, but how you move, we established that the quality (i.e. technique and form) of movement is of significantly more importance than the quantity (repetition or load). When we shift our focus from short term to long term effect of training on our bodies, it is imperative that the time spent doing quality movements should dictate our training. Thus, as one gets farther away from his/ her prime or has had a late initiation into physical training (and is still looking to squeeze true atheletic potential), quantity shouldn't hold any meaning if it comes at even a small sacrifice of quality (a PR day here and there is fine). In the next paragraphs, we dive into a key aspect of improving lifting quality, which is the focus of this post. 

What you're going to say
-----------------------

With all the hype around mobility and flexibility these days, when thinking about movement quality we have a tendency to overemphasize the role of these two. The ubiquitious SMR tools in strength/ oly gyms, CrossFit boxes and even yoga studios, seem to convey the message that a bit of pre/post/during (training) mobility is enough to achieve both quantitative and qualitative progress in training. Amongst all this, something that we often ignore (or worse, not even think of) is the concept of proprioception. Wikipedia defines it as :

 "Proprioception is the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement"

In other words, being proprioceptively sound and body aware would imply that there is no difference between (a) "How one is moving" and (b) "how they think they're moving". Conversely, an existence of such a difference between the two would mean the athlete in question can't really be classified as a perfect athlete* and if already not in pain, may be prone to injury.

say it

Explaination by example:

Let's take an example of an athlete doing a back squat. Let's assume that due to an existing condition (which the athlete is unaware of) the athlete favors his right glute more than his left. Thus looking from the front, as the athlete descends into the squat, it would appear that instead of solely going straight down, he/she also shifts horizontally to the *left* (knees outs more on the right, hence shifts left)


Problems with proprioception:

Unfortunately, the problem we see is two fold :
	- Athletes/ Coaches aren't even aware that the problem exists. 
	(More often than not the need to put in work on body awareness and proprioception isn't even recognized. )
		- often gets neglected and is hardest to work upon , almost impossible for progress to not stall while we take the time out to work on it. 
	
		- specially in an environment dominated by noise, everyone screaming for self approval 
	
		- worse part is, as the saying goes "practice makes permanent"  if principles of progressive overload  is applied while being unaware of the situation, one is essentially making an inefficient and injury prone athleticism (strength, speed, agility etc)

		- The bigger the difference, the more of "anti-progress" is made instead of progress
		
		- If unchecked, the problem gets worse and finally enters a zone where the imbalance is so bad that the athelete/ lifter begins to "feel" the issue (either through pain or difficulty in making a lift)

		- The heavier the weight and more the number of reps =>  "anti-training" is happening at a faster rate
	
Other problems with lifting delta
	- Are aware and attribute it to something commonplace ("Yeah, I know my right side is stronger")

	

	- The issue is diagnosed incorrectly and the athlete is made to do incorrect "corrective exercises"

(Below will go in a "footer" or similar section)
*Please note that a "well balanced, mobile & injury free" athelete <link to start here page> in most scenarios won't have to bother with proprioceptive issues and would be okay focussing their time in reaping gains (yes, blame it on their genetics and/or an athletic childhood). I've used all in the sentence above since a "well balanced mobile" athelete are few and far between. In fact, a lot of coaches believe for it be a myth.
