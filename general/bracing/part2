Part 2: When in doubt, ask (cross this word) SEARCH for answers (and LOOK at the legends)
----------------------------------------------

I sincerely hope you now know your <a href="../blog/bracing_part_one">WHAT</a>, for I am warning you, that if you don't and you lift for "cosmetic" reasons, you are spinning your wheels.

And that is the integrity of the torso region. The core/torso overall moves very little during the movement from start to finish. And during periods of peak tension (either horizontal or vertical), the lower abdomen region is NARROWEST. 



This is against the rather widely advocated 





SOME SAW, QUESTIONED, BUT DIDn't go any further

If you look closely it almost looks like they are sucking in their belly.

CONCLUSION
-----------

The human body does not function as multiple components working as a group or a team. It is rather (and operates as) a single unit that is composed of multiple components. 

To 

Why would you command the units separately?


Part 2: Finish
-----------------------------------
(- the "chicken and egg problem" of isolation and integration.... goal should always be integration - this will be discussed in part-4, before that an even important questions, why hasn't this come to limelight so far? --- answerd in part-3 )
