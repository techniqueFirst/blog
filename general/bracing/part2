Part 2: When in doubt, ask (cross this word) search for answers (and look at the legends)
----------------------------------------------

I sincerely hope you now know your WHAT, for I am warning you, that if you don't and you lift for "cosmetic" reasons, you are spinning your wheels. If the reason you lift is not to feed your soul, but your ego, and to look or appear "cool", you aren't ready for the information that is to follow. 

If on the other hand, lifting completes you, makes you who you are and gives you a sense of fullness, I invite you to learn the truth....

Intro/Motivation
-----------------
Modern world has harnessed us with the tools to observe, question, experiment and learn. Yet we have an almost innate tendency to keep our head down, follow old "rules" and never challenge the status quo. It matters not WHO you learn these "rules" from (coaches, friends, acquaintances or "Internet gurus"), but HOW long we continue to obey these rules. And more often than not, we tend to obey the rules even if :

1. They stop bearing us the results they once did. (i.e. stagnation past a certain weight)

2. They come at a price "greater" than their promise. (i.e. injury, need for constant maintenance, mobility)

3. It is hard or impossible to build on those rules. (i.e. integration into daily life, mix with other rules e.g. breathing allows for better activation of glutes/quads)





When it comes to lifting (i.e. movement with load) 

We tend to continue to follow rules even if something within us doesn't feel right

CONCLUSION
-----------

The human body does not function as multiple components working as a group or a team. It is rather (and operates as) a single unit that is composed of multiple components. 

To 

Why would you command the units separately?


Part 2: Finish
-----------------------------------
(- the "chicken and egg problem" of isolation and integration.... goal should always be integration - this will be discussed in part-4, before that an even important questions, why hasn't this come to limelight so far? --- answerd in part-3 )
