Part 2: When in doubt, ask (cross this word) SEARCH for answers (and LOOK at the legends)
----------------------------------------------

I sincerely hope you now know your <a href="../blog/bracing_part_one">WHAT</a>, for I am warning you, that if you don't and you lift for "cosmetic" reasons, you are spinning your wheels. If the reason you lift is not to feed your soul, but your ego, and to look or appear "cool", you aren't ready for the information that is to follow. 

If on the other hand, lifting completes you, makes you who you are and gives you a sense of fullness, I invite you to learn the truth....


The TRUTH
-----------------------
A lot can be learned by SEARCHING and LOOKING. At times we don't even need to search, as it is right there in front of us (thanks to internet). We just need to cultivate a curiosity of WHY things appear the way they do. And WHY we can't mimic or reproduce it.

A LOT is going on in these videos. And different people will notice different things. But there are some things that I couldn't unnotice. 

- The fact that these lifter's bodies seem to be INTEGRATED. As if their ENTIRE body is availble at their command to 

- The CORE overall moves very little during the movement from start to finish. And during periods of peak load, the lower abdomen region is MOST narrow. 

- During back squats there is absolutely no change in the entire torso (NO BUTT WINK!)



SOME SAW, QUESTIONED, BUT DIDn't go any further

CONCLUSION
-----------

The human body does not function as multiple components working as a group or a team. It is rather (and operates as) a single unit that is composed of multiple components. 

To 

Why would you command the units separately?


Part 2: Finish
-----------------------------------
(- the "chicken and egg problem" of isolation and integration.... goal should always be integration - this will be discussed in part-4, before that an even important questions, why hasn't this come to limelight so far? --- answerd in part-3 )
