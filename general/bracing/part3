Part 3: A taste of history: TVA Isolation vs Bracing
--------------------------------------------------------------


Introduction of the two groups
-----------------------------
<p>I have always considered dividing the worldwide health and fitness community into two groups. The first group comprises mostly of Physiotherapists, Yogis, pilates folks etc. Majority of the people in this group, would rather stay "fit" and "healthy" than lift heavy weights. Infact, some even abhor weightlifting with great intensity and deem it unnatural. In other words, this is the group of <b>people who don't lift</b>. </p>

<p>The other group, almost the exact opposite, consist of <b>people who lift</b>. These are avid (hobbyist or professional) Olympic lifters, CrossFitters, athlete turned coaches, or even bodybuilders (who enjoy functional lifting from time to time). Some of these folks enjoy lifting heavy things so much that it is almost an end in itself instead of a means to an end (one or more of strength, size, work capacity, body composition etc).</p>

Needless to say, there are folks who may lie somewhere in the middle and don't necessarily buy into any hard and fast beliefs purported by either.*


Either groups on bracing and core muscle involvement
---------------------------------------------------

From part-1, we saw that majority of the folks in the second group rely on active bracing of the entire abdominal wall. However, most of the pople in the first group don't "brace". They do (and some think that they *only* do) something called "TVA isolation" (a.k.a pulling belly button to spine). I see two reasons for this. The first is the lack of external compressive load on the spine and hence nothing to "brace" against. And second, contracting their TVA  



TVA isolation vs Bracing
--------------------------------
The "Should you suck in TVA (i.e. hollow)" vs "Should you brace?" battle is 
There has been a long (ongoing) batter between two groups. I'd term the groups on

"Suck in TVA" or "Brace"? Niether
-------------------------------------
As Julie Wiebe explains in her excellent article here, 

"The clinical question is: TA or Bracing? How about neither! My beef with both ideas is the same â€“ they advocate a static, simultaneous sustained hold at the center: a uniform response. Essentially activating a trunk isometric while performing peripheral arm and leg movements. An isometric is simply put: un-functional, the opposite of the growing trend toward functional patterning programs. What does a whole trunk isometric (bracing) or a TA isometric teach our clients about movement? About balance? About performance? Before we all jump from TA isolation to the bracing bandwagon, the most important question to answer is: Does a static hold train the trunk in the way that it actually produces central postural control within movement patterns?"
