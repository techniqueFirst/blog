Part 3: A taste of history: TVA Isolation vs Bracing
--------------------------------------------------------------


Introduction of the two groups
-----------------------------
<p>I have always considered dividing the worldwide health and fitness community into two groups. The first group comprises mostly of Physiotherapists, Yogis, pilates folks etc. Majority of the people in this group, would rather stay "fit" and "healthy" than lift heavy weights. Infact, some even abhor weightlifting with great intensity and deem it unnatural. In other words, this is the group of <b>people who don't lift</b>. </p>

<p>The other group, almost the exact opposite, consist of <b>people who lift</b>. These are avid (hobbyist or professional) Olympic lifters, CrossFitters, athlete turned coaches, or even bodybuilders (who enjoy functional lifting from time to time). Some of these folks enjoy lifting heavy things so much that it is almost an end in itself instead of a means to an end (one or more of strength, size, work capacity, body composition etc).</p>

Needless to say, there are folks who may lie somewhere in the middle and don't necessarily buy into any hard and fast beliefs purported by either.*


Either groups on bracing and core muscle involvement
---------------------------------------------------

Although majority of the folks in the second group rely on active bracing of the entire abdominal wall a.k.a 360-degrees-bracing/ take-a-big-breath-and-make-your-core-tight (as we saw in part-1), most in the first group don't "brace". Poeple in this group are told to do something called "TVA isolation" (a.k.a pulling-belly-button-to-spine/ make-yourself-skinny**). 


I see a few reasons for this. The first is the lack of an external compressive load on the spine (and hence nothing to brace against). Second, contracting TVA alone does give one a sense of spinal protection. And third, possibly the most important, is that one can breathe through a TVA isolation which makes it appealing for holding longer poses or gracefully moving from one pose to the next. 


TVA isolation vs Bracing
--------------------------------
The "Should you suck in TVA (i.e. hollow)" vs "Should you brace?" battle is 
There has been a long (ongoing) batter between two groups. I'd term the groups on

"Suck in TVA" or "Brace"? Niether
-------------------------------------
As Julie Wiebe explains in her excellent article here, 

"The clinical question is: TA or Bracing? How about neither! My beef with both ideas is the same â€“ they advocate a static, simultaneous sustained hold at the center: a uniform response. Essentially activating a trunk isometric while performing peripheral arm and leg movements. An isometric is simply put: un-functional, the opposite of the growing trend toward functional patterning programs. What does a whole trunk isometric (bracing) or a TA isometric teach our clients about movement? About balance? About performance? Before we all jump from TA isolation to the bracing bandwagon, the most important question to answer is: Does a static hold train the trunk in the way that it actually produces central postural control within movement patterns?"


Argument against base wider

* I was in the second group (pure meathead) as of 2 years ago. Over the past 2 years, I have mingled quite a bit with some of the great minds in the first group. I've managed to learn (intellectually and experentially) a whole lot about posture/core strength. Most of these things are never talked about in the lifting circle, and are (almost) laughed at. But again, you always resist, ridicule or fear what you don't understand. 

** TA isolation might be really hard for most of the lifting folks who are used to bracing only and/or have poor body awareness. But it is not impossible. Rectus abdominis should not be involved when contracting TVA only.
