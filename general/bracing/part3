Part 3: A taste of history: TA Isolation vs Bracing
--------------------------------------------------------------

<p>I have always considered dividing the worldwide health and fitness community into two groups. The first group comprises mostly of Physiotherapists, Yoga gurus, pilates folks etc. Majority of the people in this group, would rather stay "fit" and "healthy" than lift heavy weights. Infact, some even abhor weightlifting with great intensity and deem it unnatural. Basically this is the group of <b>people who don't lift</b>. </p>

<p>The other group, almost the exact opposite, consist of <b>people who lift</b>. These are avid (hobbyist or professional) Olympic lifters, CrossFitters, athlete turned coaches, or even bodybuilders (who enjoy functional lifting from time to time). Some of these folks enjoy lifting heavy things so much that it is almost an end in itself instead of a means to an end (one or more of strength, size, work capacity, body composition etc).</p>

Needless to say, there are folks who may lie somewhere in the middle and don't necessarily buy into any hard and fast beliefs purported by either. For the sake of simplicity, this post will NOT take these people into consideration to get the main point accross. 



There has been a long (ongoing) batter between two groups. I'd term the groups on
