Part 3: Pause and a taste of history: The battle (TA vs rectus)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Intro/Motivation/Philopsophy  
-----------------
Modern world has harnessed us with the tools to observe, question, experiment and learn. Yet we have an almost innate tendency to keep our head down, follow old "rules" and never challenge the status quo. It matters not WHO we learn these "rules" from (coaches, friends, acquaintances or "Internet gurus"), but HOW long we continue to obey these rules. In most cases I have noticed that people tend to obey the rules even if:

They stop bearing the results they once did. 

They come at a price greater than their promise.

It is really hard or impossible to build on those rules.


# Examples of above general observations:
(i.e. stagnation past a certain weight)

(i.e. injury, need for constant maintenance, mobility)

(i.e. integration into daily life, mix with other rules e.g. breathing allows for better activation of glutes/quads)
