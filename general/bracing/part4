Part 4 : Isolation is okay, Integration is key 
-----------------------------------------------------


Let's go back and watch a couple of videos:

<INlcude/link to videos here>

"Observation on Integration"
----------------------------
The fact that these lifter's bodies seem to be INTEGRATED. As if their ENTIRE body is availble at their command to move the way they are doing. I now know they aren't thinking "elbows" up or any such silly queues for. Remember that lifting weights isn't about moving the weights as much it is about moving yourself WITH the weights. 

- During back squats there is absolutely no change in the entire torso (NO BUTT WINK!)





THE FORK IN THE ROAD :
---------------------

People don't have control, of the key muscle groups. 

Step:1 Have sufficient control of key muscle groups.
Step:2 Be able to understand how to brace.
Step:3 Execute a proper brace without "thinking" too much. 


Before you start complaining that it is true late OR the fact that you are too old. I'd say otherwise and argue that with true sincerety, we can reverse engineer the core. The human body is amazing 


BUT THERE's HOPE
----------------
 

Understand:
- Understanding the different components  

Isolate:
- Training the brain to find them. 
- Strengthen the neural connection 

Integrate
- Control muscles during day to day movement
- Control msucles while loaded


Part-4: Finish
-----------------------------------------------------
 - Lack of awareness, incorrect order of activation
