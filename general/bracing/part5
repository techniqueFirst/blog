part5: Understand, isolate, control, integrate
----------------------------------------------------------------

What is integration?
---------------------

We have used the term integration or integrated a lot of times thus far and it warrants a proper definition. Here is how we would do so in this context. 

Being integrated is a state of one's body when, given a high level explaination (or demonstration) of a movement pattern or a part or position thereof, an ideal (or near ideal) body alignment can be achieved without the need for low level (i.e. isolated) cueing or thinking. 

A kid squatting to pick something off the floor is an example of his body being integrated for that movement pattern. He just needs to see someone do it to execute it perfectly. 

<Insert kid picture here>

Obviously, the definition is not immediately true for whole complex movements (e.g. a full Snatch or a backflip). And an integrated athlete will still have to "train" his balance, coordination and agility for that movement. However, such training would be considerably "easy" and take almost exponentially less time than the average athlete. 


Integration and Bracing
-----------------------
If you have not yet realized by now, when one is integrated, there is no need to remember to brace. Bracing is the side effect. In fact, from an integrated athlete's point of view, cues like "take a big breath and make your core tight" will not make sense and will be confusing. And high level cues like that of "Stay tight and upright" will be more than enough, if needed at all. 


Why is integration hard/difficult
---------------------------------

<p>the "chicken and egg problem" of isolation and integration.... how to INTEGRATE if awareness of isolated components isn't there? </p>

<p>People don't have control, of the key muscle groups. </p>

<p>To do that one has to understand, isolate, integrate ..</p>

 But to do that we need to understand the human body better. But it is hard (Lack of awareness/ control of certain muscle groups)

So need to "find" / understand each muscle group 



There is hope
-------------
Before you start complaining that it is too late OR the fact that you are too old. I'd say otherwise and argue that with true sincerety, we can reverse engineer the human body. The human body is amazing. 


Understand/Isolate/Integrate (Repeat)
-------------------------------------

Understand:
- Understanding the different components  

Isolate:
- Training the brain to find them. 
- Strengthen the neural connection 
- ISolate them not to learn how to CONTROL them, not to build them

Integrate
- Control muscles during day to day movement
- Control msucles while loaded
