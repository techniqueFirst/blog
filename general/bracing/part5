<b>The chicken and egg problem</b>


<p>the "chicken and egg problem" of isolation and integration.... how to INTEGRATE if awareness of isolated components isn't there?</p>

<p>People don't have control, of the key muscle groups. </p>

<!--
Step:1 Have sufficient control of key muscle groups.
Step:2 Be able to understand how to brace.
Step:3 Execute a proper brace without "thinking" too much. 
-->

<p>
Before you start complaining that it is too late OR the fact that you are too old. I'd say otherwise and argue that with true sincerety, we can reverse engineer the core. The human body is amazing <p> 


<p>To do that one has to understand, isolate, integrate ..</p>


 But to do that we need to understand the human body better. But it is hard (Lack of awareness/ control of certain muscle groups)

So need to "find" / understand each muscle group 

- ISolate them not to learn how to CONTROL them, not to build them

- Integrate into daily movement and heavy lifting


BUT THERE's HOPE
----------------
 

Understand:
- Understanding the different components  

Isolate:
- Training the brain to find them. 
- Strengthen the neural connection 

Integrate
- Control muscles during day to day movement
- Control msucles while loaded



Challenges:
-----------------------------------------------------
 - Lack of awareness, incorrect order of activation
