 

Integration and Bracing
-----------------------
If you have not yet realized by now, when one is integrated, there is no need to remember to brace. Bracing is the side effect. In fact, from an integrated athlete's point of view, cues like "take a big breath and make your core tight" will not make sense and will be confusing. And high level cues like that of "Stay tight and upright" will be more than enough, if needed at all. 


Why is integration hard/difficult
---------------------------------

<p>the "chicken and egg problem" of isolation and integration.... how to INTEGRATE if awareness of isolated components isn't there? </p>

<p>People don't have control, of the key muscle groups. </p>

<p>To do that one has to understand, isolate, integrate ..</p>

 But to do that we need to understand the human body better. But it is hard (Lack of awareness/ control of certain muscle groups)

So need to "find" / understand each muscle group
