What is integration?
---------------------

We have used the term integration or integrated a lot of times thus far and it warrants a proper definition. Here is how we would do so in this context. 

Being integrated is a state of one's body when, given a high level explaination (or demonstration) of a movement pattern or a part or position thereof, an ideal (or near ideal) positioning can be achieved without the need for low level (i.e. isolated) cueing or thinking. 

A kid squatting to pick something off the floor is an example of his body being integrated for that movement pattern. He just needs to see someone do it to execute it perfectly. 

For the definition to be true for (whole) complex movements (e.g. a full Snatch) an (integrated)athlete ofcourse will have to "train" his balance, coordination and agility for that movement. However, note that such training would be considerably "easy" and take (almost) exponentially less time than the average athlete. 


on other factors (balance, coordination and agility) and call for considerable practice.

Obviously, for the definition to be true for complex motor patterns, considerable practice 


- A state to be strived for, to achieve optimal positions in all movements. An ideal elbow positioning while performing a back squat would not be a possibility without a perfect Snatch overhead position. 



Integration and Bracing

Why is integration hard/difficult
---------------------------------

<p>the "chicken and egg problem" of isolation and integration.... how to INTEGRATE if awareness of isolated components isn't there? </p>

<p>People don't have control, of the key muscle groups. </p>

<p>To do that one has to understand, isolate, integrate ..</p>

 But to do that we need to understand the human body better. But it is hard (Lack of awareness/ control of certain muscle groups)

So need to "find" / understand each muscle group 



There is hope
-------------
Before you start complaining that it is too late OR the fact that you are too old. I'd say otherwise and argue that with true sincerety, we can reverse engineer the human body. The human body is amazing. 


Understand/Isolate/Integrate (Repeat)
-------------------------------------

Understand:
- Understanding the different components  

Isolate:
- Training the brain to find them. 
- Strengthen the neural connection 
- ISolate them not to learn how to CONTROL them, not to build them

Integrate
- Control muscles during day to day movement
- Control msucles while loaded
