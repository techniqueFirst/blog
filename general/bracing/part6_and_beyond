Part-6: Understand, Isolate, Control, Integrate
<summary>

"To command the unit we must become it. And integration is the only way. The path towards which is paved with undestanding of limitations and isolating them to regain control. Limitations, that we know and most importantly, those that we don't know."


AWARENESS!!!


Why is integration hard/difficult
---------------------------------

<p>the "chicken and egg problem" of isolation and integration.... how to INTEGRATE if awareness of isolated components isn't there? </p>

<p>People don't have control, of the key muscle groups. </p>

<p>To do that one has to understand, isolate, integrate ..</p>

 But to do that we need to understand the human body better. But it is hard (Lack of awareness/ control of certain muscle groups)

So need to "find" / understand each muscle group

There is hope

Before you start complaining that it is too late OR the fact that you are too old. I'd say otherwise and argue that with true sincerety, we can reverse engineer the human body. The human body is amazing.

So need to "find" / understand each muscle group 

- ISolate them not to learn how to CONTROL them, not to build them

- Integrate into daily movement and heavy lifting



Understand/Isolate/Integrate (Repeat)
-------------------------------------

Understand:
- Understanding the different components  

Isolate:
- Training the brain to find them. 
- Strengthen the neural connection 
- ISolate them not to learn how to CONTROL them, not to build them

Integrate
- Control muscles during day to day movement
- Control msucles while loaded
