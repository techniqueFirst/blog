Part-6:, Isolate, Control, Integrate



 


The Chicken and Egg problem
 -----------------------------
 how to INTEGRATE if neuromuscular awareness of isolated components isn't there? </p>
 
- Isolate them not to learn how to CONTROL them, not to build them


For the serious and determined:
-------------------------------

Perceive
Surrender your strengths (Strong muscles that are used to taking over) and allowing your brain to find the hidden muscles.



Control:
By repeated isolation them repeatedly, by sending "commands" from brain

Integrate
- By controling muscles during day to day movement
- Control msucles while loaded
